# Fix Render Deployment - Axios Module Error

## Problem
The deployment is failing because the `axios` module is missing from the backend dependencies, but it's being used in `backend/server/routes/serviceReports.js`.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Backend Dependencies
- ✅ Added `axios: "^1.6.0"` to `backend/package.json` dependencies
- ✅ Fixed `apprunner.yaml` build paths (was using incorrect `backend/server` path)

### 2. Next Steps for Render Deployment

#### Option A: Redeploy with Fixed Dependencies
1. **Commit the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Add missing axios dependency for Render deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Trigger a new deployment in Render:**
   - Go to your Render dashboard
   - Find your service
   - Click "Manual Deploy" or wait for auto-deploy if enabled

#### Option B: Install Dependencies Locally First (Recommended)
1. **Install the missing dependency in backend:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install axios
   ```

2. **Test locally to ensure everything works:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Then commit and deploy:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Add missing axios dependency"
   git push origin main
   ```

### 3. Verify the Fix
After deployment, check:
- ✅ Backend starts without module errors
- ✅ Service reports functionality works
- ✅ Template generation works (uses axios for downloading templates)

### 4. Files Modified
- `backend/package.json` - Added axios dependency
- `apprunner.yaml` - Fixed build and run paths

### 5. Why This Happened
The `serviceReports.js` file imports and uses axios for:
- Line 8: `const axios = require('axios');`
- Line 172: Downloading report templates
- Line 890: Fetching template files from Cloudinary

But axios wasn't listed in the backend's package.json dependencies, causing the "Cannot find module 'axios'" error during deployment.

## Additional Notes
- The Dockerfile looks correct and doesn't need changes
- All other dependencies appear to be properly listed
- The error should be completely resolved after installing axios
