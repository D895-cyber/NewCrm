### Backend Changes

#### 1. **Projector Model** (`server/models/Projector.js`)
```javascript
warrantyStart: {
  type: Date,
  required: true
}
```

#### 2. **Projector API** (`server/routes/projectors.js`)
```javascript
// Get AMC contract details
const AMCContract = require('../models/AMCContract');
const amcContract = await AMCContract.findOne({ projectorSerial: serial })
  .sort({ contractStartDate: -1 });

// Include in response
amcContract: amcContract
```

### Frontend Changes

- Added warranty start date display
- Enhanced warranty end date with calendar icon
- Added AMC contract information section

#### 2. **Form Updates**
- Added warranty start date field to new projector form
- Updated state management to include warranty start

## 📱 Mobile PWA Considerations

The enhancement is fully compatible with mobile devices:
- **Responsive Design**: Warranty information adapts to mobile screens
- **Touch-Friendly**: Easy navigation on mobile devices
- **Offline Support**: Warranty dates cached for offline access

## 🚀 Usage

### Viewing Asset Details
1. Navigate to Projectors page
2. Search for a projector by serial number
3. View enhanced warranty information:
   - **Warranty Start**: AMC contract start date
   - **Warranty End**: AMC contract end date
   - **AMC Contract**: Full contract details

### Adding New Projectors
1. Click "Add New Projector"
2. Fill in warranty start date (AMC contract start)
3. Fill in warranty end date (AMC contract end)
4. Save projector with complete warranty information

## 🔄 Data Migration

### For Existing Projectors
Run the migration script to update existing projectors:
```bash
cd server/migrations
node update-schemas.js
```

This will:
- Find projectors without warranty start dates
- Set warranty start from AMC contract start date
- Fall back to install date if no AMC contract exists

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Script
Run the test script to verify implementation:
```bash
node test_warranty_enhancement.js
```

### Manual Testing
1. **Frontend**: Check asset detail page displays warranty start
2. **API**: Verify projector endpoint returns AMC contract data
3. **Database**: Confirm warranty start dates are populated

## 📊 Benefits

### For Users
- **Complete Warranty View**: See full warranty period at a glance
- **Contract Transparency**: Access to AMC contract details
- **Better Planning**: Understand warranty coverage timeline

### For Business
- **Service Planning**: Plan services within warranty periods

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

2. **Contract Renewal**: Automated renewal reminders
3. **Service Coverage**: Link services to warranty periods
4. **Reporting**: Warranty status analytics

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Missing Warranty Start**: Run migration script
2. **No AMC Data**: Check if projector has associated AMC contract
3. **Display Issues**: Verify frontend components are updated

### Debug Steps
1. Check database for warranty start dates
2. Verify API returns AMC contract data
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Validate frontend component rendering

## 📝 Notes
