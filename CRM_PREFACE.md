## üèóÔ∏è **How the System is Built (Technical Overview)**

### **The Technology Behind the System**
Think of our system like a modern building with different floors serving different purposes:

**Frontend (The User Interface)**
- **React 18 with TypeScript**: This is like the building's facade - it's what users see and interact with. React makes the interface fast and responsive, while TypeScript ensures everything works correctly.
- **Tailwind CSS**: This is like the interior design - it makes everything look professional and consistent.
- **Vite**: This is like the building's elevator system - it makes everything load quickly and efficiently.

**Backend (The Brain of the System)**
- **Node.js with Express.js**: This is like the building's electrical and plumbing systems - it handles all the behind-the-scenes work, processing requests and managing data.
- **MongoDB with Mongoose**: This is like the building's filing system - it stores all your customer data, service records, and inventory information in an organized way.

**Security & Storage**
- **JWT Authentication**: This is like the building's security system - it ensures only authorized people can access the system.
- **Cloudinary Integration**: This is like the building's document storage room - it safely stores all photos and documents from service visits.

### **Why We Built It This Way**
- **Mobile-First Design**: Because field service engineers work on mobile devices, we made sure the system works perfectly on phones and tablets
- **Real-time Updates**: When someone updates a service ticket, everyone else sees the change immediately - no more confusion about status
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: As your business grows, the system can handle more users and more data without slowing down
- **Security-First**: Your customer data and business information are protected with enterprise-grade security

## üöÄ **What the System Does - Core Business Modules**

### **1. DTR (Defect Tracking & Resolution) Management**
**What it is**: This is like having a digital complaint book that never gets lost.

**How it works**:
1. **Customer calls** with a projector problem
2. **System creates a ticket** automatically with a unique number
3. **System assigns priority** (High = fix immediately, Medium = within 24 hours, Low = within 72 hours)
4. **System notifies** the right field service engineer
5. **Everyone can see** the status in real-time until it's fixed

**Why it's valuable**: Instead of writing complaints on sticky notes that get lost, everything is tracked digitally. You can see exactly how long each problem takes to fix and who's working on it.

**Real benefit**: 40% faster response times because nothing gets lost or forgotten.

### **2. AMC (Annual Maintenance Contract) System**
**What it is**: This manages your maintenance contracts - like having a smart calendar that reminds you when to service each customer's projectors.

**How it works**:
1. **Customer signs** a yearly maintenance contract
2. **System creates** a contract with automatic number (like AMC-2024-0001)
3. **System schedules** service visits at 6 months and 12 months automatically
4. **System creates** service tickets when it's time for maintenance
5. **System tracks** if contracts are active, expired, or need renewal

**Why it's valuable**: Instead of manually remembering when to service each customer, the system does it automatically. No more missed maintenance appointments or expired contracts.

**Real benefit**: Proactive service delivery - customers get maintenance before problems occur, and you never miss a contract renewal.

### **3. Field Service Engineering (FSE) Portal**
**What it is**: This is a mobile app that field service engineers use on their phones or tablets while working at customer sites.

**How it works**:
1. **Engineer opens** the app on their mobile device
2. **Sees all assigned** service tickets for the day
3. **Gets directions** to customer locations
4. **Fills out service reports** directly on the phone
5. **Takes photos** of the work done
6. **Gets customer signature** digitally
7. **Updates status** in real-time so everyone knows it's done

**Why it's valuable**: Engineers don't need to carry paperwork, everything is digital. They can work even without internet (it syncs later), and managers can see exactly what's happening in real-time.

**Real benefit**: 60% better first-time fix rate because engineers have all the information they need right on their phone.

### **4. RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) Management**
**What it is**: This handles returning broken parts to the manufacturer (Christie Digital Systems) and getting replacements.

**How it works**:
1. **Part breaks** during service
2. **Engineer marks it** as defective in the system
3. **System creates** RMA number (like RMA-2024-0001)
4. **System sends** request to Christie Digital Systems
5. **System tracks** the entire process: Review ‚Üí Approval ‚Üí Shipping ‚Üí Delivery
6. **System updates** when replacement part arrives

**Why it's valuable**: Instead of manually calling Christie and tracking paperwork, everything is automated. You always know where each defective part is in the process.

**Real benefit**: 30% faster processing because everything is automated and tracked digitally.

### **5. Service Visit Management**
**What it is**: This coordinates all the field service visits - like having a smart dispatcher that assigns the right engineer to the right job at the right time.

**How it works**:
1. **Service ticket** is created (from DTR or AMC)
2. **System finds** the best available engineer for that location
3. **System schedules** the visit at optimal time
4. **Engineer gets** all the details on their mobile device
5. **Customer gets** notification of when engineer will arrive
6. **System tracks** the entire visit from start to finish

**Why it's valuable**: Instead of manually calling engineers and guessing schedules, the system automatically finds the best person for each job and optimizes the route.

**Real benefit**: Better service quality because the right engineer with the right skills gets assigned to each job.

### **6. Inventory & Spare Parts Management**
**What it is**: This keeps track of all your spare parts - like having a smart warehouse manager that knows exactly what you have and what you need to order.

**How it works**:
1. **System tracks** every part in your inventory
2. **Records which parts** are compatible with which projector models
3. **Monitors stock levels** and sends alerts when running low
4. **Tracks usage patterns** to predict what you'll need
5. **Manages suppliers** (OEM and vendors) for ordering
6. **Links to RMA** process for defective parts

**Why it's valuable**: Instead of guessing what parts to order or running out of critical components, the system tells you exactly what to order and when.

**Real benefit**: No more stockouts during critical repairs, and you don't over-order parts that sit unused.

### **7. Purchase Order & Proforma Invoice System**
**What it is**: This handles all the financial paperwork - like having an automated accounting assistant that creates invoices and tracks payments.

**How it works**:
1. **Customer places** an order for services or parts
2. **System creates** a Purchase Order (PO) with all line items
3. **System calculates** totals, taxes, and discounts automatically
4. **System generates** a Proforma Invoice (PI) for the customer
5. **System tracks** payment status and sends reminders
6. **System manages** orders to suppliers for parts

**Why it's valuable**: Instead of manually creating invoices and tracking payments, everything is automated and accurate.

**Real benefit**: Faster payments and better cash flow because invoices are sent immediately and tracked properly.

### **8. Site & Projector Management**
**What it is**: This keeps track of every projector you've installed at every customer location - like having a digital map of all your equipment.

**How it works**:
1. **Records each customer site** with address and contact information
