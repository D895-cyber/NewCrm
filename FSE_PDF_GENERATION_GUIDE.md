# FSE Report PDF Generation Guide

## Overview

This guide explains the comprehensive PDF generation functionality implemented for FSE (Field Service Engineer) reports. The system automatically generates professional PDF reports when FSEs complete their service workflows.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Automatic PDF Generation
- **Location**: `frontend/src/components/mobile/FSEWorkflow.tsx`
- **Trigger**: When FSE completes service in `handleServiceComplete` function
- **Functionality**: Automatically generates and downloads PDF after successful report creation
- **Error Handling**: Non-blocking - if PDF generation fails, the service completion still succeeds

### 2. Manual PDF Preview Generation
- **Location**: `frontend/src/components/mobile/FSEWorkflow.tsx` - `ReportGenerationStep`
- **Trigger**: "Generate PDF Preview" button in the report generation step
- **Functionality**: Allows FSEs to preview their report as PDF before final submission
- **Use Case**: FSEs can review their report format and content before completing the service

### 3. ASCOMP Report PDF Export
- **Location**: `frontend/src/components/ASCOMPServiceReportForm.tsx`
- **Trigger**: Download button in the completion modal
- **Functionality**: Generates comprehensive ASCOMP-style PDF reports
- **Features**: Professional formatting, complete service details, technical measurements

### 4. Report Management PDF Export
- **Location**: Multiple components (ReportsPage, ServiceReportsAnalysisPage, etc.)
- **Trigger**: Export buttons in report listings
- **Functionality**: Download existing reports as PDFs
- **Features**: Supports both original FSE PDFs and generated PDFs

## Technical Implementation

### PDF Generation Library
- **Primary Library**: jsPDF (JavaScript PDF generation)
- **HTML to Canvas**: html2canvas (for converting HTML content to PDF)
- **Fallback**: Text export if PDF generation fails

### Export Function
The main export function is located in `frontend/src/utils/export.ts`:

```typescript
export const exportServiceReportToPDF = async (report: any): Promise<void>
```

This function:
1. Validates report data
2. Creates HTML content with professional styling
3. Converts HTML to canvas using html2canvas
4. Generates PDF using jsPDF
5. Downloads the PDF file automatically

## Usage Instructions

### For FSEs (Field Service Engineers)

#### During Service Workflow
1. Complete all workflow steps (photos, work details, etc.)
2. In the "Generate Report" step, you have three options:
   - **Generate Basic Report**: Creates a simple report
   - **Fill ASCOMP Report**: Opens detailed ASCOMP form
   - **Generate PDF Preview**: Creates a preview PDF of current data

#### After Service Completion
- PDF is automatically generated and downloaded
- Success notification confirms PDF generation
- If PDF generation fails, you'll get a warning but service completion still succeeds

#### From ASCOMP Form
1. Fill out the comprehensive ASCOMP service report
2. Submit the report
3. Click "Download PDF Report" in the completion modal
4. PDF will be generated and downloaded automatically

### For Administrators

#### From Reports Section
1. Navigate to "Service Reports" or "Reports Analysis"
2. Find the desired report in the list
3. Click the "Export" or "Download PDF" button
4. PDF will be generated and downloaded

#### Batch Export
- Multiple reports can be exported individually
- Each export generates a separate PDF file
- Original FSE PDFs are preserved when available

## File Naming Convention

PDFs are automatically named using the following pattern:
- **Format**: `ASCOMP_Report_{ReportNumber}_{Date}.pdf`
- **Example**: `ASCOMP_Report_REPORT-1704067200000-abc123_2024-01-15.pdf`
- **Preview Format**: `ASCOMP_Report_PREVIEW-{timestamp}_{Date}.pdf`

## Error Handling

### PDF Generation Failures
- Non-blocking: Service completion continues even if PDF fails
- Fallback: Text export option available
- User notification: Clear error messages with guidance
- Retry option: Users can retry PDF generation later

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: PDF generation fails with "Invalid report data"
**Solution**: Ensure all required fields are filled in the report

#### Issue: PDF appears blank or corrupted
**Solution**: Check browser console for html2canvas errors, try refreshing and retrying

#### Issue: PDF download doesn't start
**Solution**: Check browser download settings, ensure pop-ups are allowed

#### Issue: Large photos cause PDF generation to fail
**Solution**: Photos are automatically optimized, but very large files may need manual resizing
